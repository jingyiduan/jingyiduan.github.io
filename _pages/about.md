Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a third year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu) 
at Cornell University. I am very fortunate to be advised 
by [Prof. Yang Ning](https://yangning.stat.cornell.edu).  

Prior to Cornell, I received M.A. in Statistics in 2020 from Yale 
University and 
 Bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics in 2019 from University of Science and Technology 
 of China (USTC).

I am broadly interested in developing statistical methodology with theoretical 
guarantees, where the scientific problems arise from interdisciplinary research
 with high-dimensional and complex data. Specifically, I'm interested in 
 high-dimensional inference and statistical machine learning.
